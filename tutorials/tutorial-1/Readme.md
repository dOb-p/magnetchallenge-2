# Tutorial 1

This folder hosts the Training and Testing example code, data, and tools needed for next-step autoregressive prediction in MagNet Challenge 2. 

Currently 7 files are included:

- 3C90_Testing.h5: A small testing data sequence for 3C90
- 3C90_Training.h5: A small training dataset for 3C90
- Demo_LSTM_Testing.ipynb: Python notebook for LSTM Testing
- Demo_LSTM_Training.ipynb: Python notebook for LSTM Training
- Model_LSTM_New.sd: A low performance NN model trained by the Demo file. 
- Model_LSTM_Princeton.sd: A high performance NN model previously trained.
- Normalization_Params.json: Normalization parameters needed for training and testing. 

The slides for Tutorial 1 are included in the PDF file.
