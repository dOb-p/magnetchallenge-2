## MagNet Challenge 2026 January Final Test 

November 15th, 2025 – Release of the final evaluation dataset

On January 15th, 2026, the final test results are due for 5 new materials (A–E):

- Step 1: Download the [Data](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/o07x7fa6d5elev19pzd1w/AISuBEWf8LQVszFeoaTlqY4?rlkey=8ec7mqukfr9no61h193zb4qdb&dl=0) for the 5 new materials each consisting of around 1,000 randomly sampled 1,000 steps segments from the Transient database.

- Step 2: Use this database to evaluate your already-trained models for 5 new materials.
  
- Step 3: Submit prediction results as 5 separate CSV files (one for each material) with the number of parameters for each material. Zip your Models and Results and send them to pelsmagnet@gmail.com.

We will use sequence relative error and energy relative error to evaluate your models.


January 31st, 2026 – Final report submission

- Submit a 4-page report in IEEE TPEL PDF format, briefly describing your key methods and concepts.


February 2026 – Model Validation and Ranking

- The submitted models will be validated and ranked based on their performance.
