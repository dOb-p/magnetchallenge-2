## Evaluation Criterias

The judging committee will evaluate the results of each team with the following criterias.
- Model accuracy: core loss and B-H trajectory prediction accuracy (lower error better)
- Model size: number of parameters the model needs to store for each material (smaller model better)
- Model explanability: explanability of the model based on existing physical insights (more explainable better)
- Model novelty: new concepts or insights presented by the model (newer insights better)
- Software quality: quality of the software engineering (more concise better)
