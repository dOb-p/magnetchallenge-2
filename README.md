## Evaluation Timeline

- 06-15-2023 Evaluate the concept proposals and ensure all teams understand the competition rules.
- 11-10-2023 Evaluate the 10 models the teams developed for the 10 materials and provide feedback for improvements.
- 12-31-2023 Evaluate the 3 new models the teams developed for the 3 new materials and announce the winners.

## Evaluation Criterias

The judging committee will evaluate the results of each team with the following criterias.
- Model accuracy (30%): core loss prediction accuracy evaluated by 95th percentile error (lower error better)
- Model size (30%): number of parameters the model needs to store for each material (smaller model better)
- Model explanability (20%): explanability of the model based on existing physical insights (more explainable better)
- Model novelty (10%): new concepts or insights presented by the model (newer insights better)
- Software quality (10%): quality of the software engineering (more concise better)
