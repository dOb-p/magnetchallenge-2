## MagNet Challenge 2025 November Preliminary Test 

On November 15th, a preliminary test result is due for the selected 2 materials (N87 and 3C90): 

- Step 1: Download the [Data](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/o07x7fa6d5elev19pzd1w/AISuBEWf8LQVszFeoaTlqY4?rlkey=8ec7mqukfr9no61h193zb4qdb&dl=0) for the 10 existing materials each consisting of more than 4,500 randomly sampled 1,000 steps segments from the Transient database.

- Step 2: Use this database to evaluate your already-trained models for N87 and 3C90 only.

- Step 3: Report your results following the provided [Template](Pre_Evaluation_Results.pdf). Zip your Models and Results and send them to pelsmagnet@gmail.com.

We will use sequence relative error and energy relative error to evaluate your models.

The purpose of the preliminary test is to get you familiar with the final testing process. The preliminary test results have nothing to do with the final competition results.
